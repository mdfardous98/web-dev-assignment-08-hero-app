    "description": "An online dating and geosocial networking application. In Tinder, users 'swipe right' to like or 'swipe left' to dislike other users' profiles, which include their photo, a short bio, and a list of their interests. Tinder uses a 'double opt-in' system where both users must like each other before they can exchange messages. It pioneered this swipe interface, which has since been adopted by many other services. The app is widely recognized for its impact on modern dating culture, making it easier for people to connect based on initial attraction and geographic proximity. Premium features offer unlimited swipes and location changes.",
